![headshot](images/studentwdisabilities.jpg)

## Characteristics
The student with accessibility disabilities is a doctoral student who is similar to the Student Persona. He needed to use the repository to review the scholarly work coming out of his prospective program (including ETDs and scholarly articles); will be accessing the same materials during his on-campus research; is responsible for submitting his own dissertation and possibly also his own scholarly publications while being a student; and wants to be able to find his own research and have others find his research online. 
He is also legally blind, has limited mobility in his hands and arms, and uses adaptive technology at home workstation. He has a specialized keyboard, a joystick, a touchscreen device, and a large-print monitor. For some sites where the content is still too difficult to read, he will use screen magnification software even though he finds it difficult to unpleasant to use.
The student has difficulty seeing text that is too small or that does not respond to browser settings to size up or zoom in. He also has trouble when the text does not contrast well against its background. TO navigate websites, he switches back and forth between his joystick and using keyboard controls. He is most comfortable when he can tab through a website, because it can be difficult to pinpoint buttons with the joystick or touchscreen. 


## Goals
The goals of the student with disabilities are the same as those of the [Student](/personas/student.md).
