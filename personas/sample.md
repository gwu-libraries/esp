*We will be using personas in this project to:*
1. *Organize our knowledge and beliefs about who are the most likely and most important users of the ETD stewardship system*
2. *Prioritize feature development through the creation and prioritization of user stories based on the personas*
3. *Potentially identify areas where additional research into user needs or behavior would be useful*

# Name
*Give the persona a meaningful name that is short but descriptive of their role in the ETD program.*

## Picture
*A photograph of a person who will serve as the “face” of this persona. Having this helps to focus on and empathize with the persona as a specific, real person with specific, real needs and wants. Flickr is a good source.*

## Characteristics
*This section answers the question “Who?” A few sentences summarizing who this persona is and what their relationship is to the ETD stewardship program. Include only details that are relevant to this particular project.*

## Goals
*This section answers the question “Why?” Bullet-pointed list of up to five high-level goals this persona has for the ETD stewardship system, listed with the most critical one first. These goals will be unpacked in the user stories, where they will become the third “in order to…” part of the statements.*
