# Archivist

## Characteristics
The Archivist is a librarian who has curatorial responsibility for ETDs submitted to the library. She answers reference questions about theses & dissertations, and also works to ensure their long-term preservation. While the Archivist has more familiarity with the ETD system and its technology than the average person, she is not a developer. Outside of special projects, the archivist typically spends an hour or less of her time per week on ETDs in particular.

## Goals
1. The Archivist’s primary goal for the ETD system is the long-term preservation of the ETDs, which is defined as the ability to access and use the main body of the ETDs over time (not necessarily any supplementary files).
2. The Archivist needs the ETD system to provide improved findability and access to the ETDs, particularly by department or academic subject.
3. The Archivist is also concerned with bit-level preservation of supplementary files submitted with ETDs, but is less concerned with preserving access to the many file formats they may include.
4. The Archivist wants the ETD system to provide open access to ETDs for researchers who don’t have access to ProQuest.
