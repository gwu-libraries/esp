# Archivist

## Characteristics
The Archivist is a librarian who has curatorial responsibility for ETDs submitted to the library. She answers reference questions about theses & dissertations, and also works with the Preservation Officer to ensure their long-term preservation. She works with the Preservation Officer to make sure that preservation workflows and long-term preservation planning take into account any special preservation needs of the ETDs, and helps carry out some of these workflows as they apply to the ETDs. While the Archivist has more familiarity with the ETD system and its technology than the average person, she is not a developer. Outside of special projects, the archivist typically spends an hour or less of her time per week on ETDs in particular.

## Goals
1. The Archivist’s primary goal for the ETD system is the long-term preservation of the ETDs, which is defined as the ability to access and use the main body of the ETDs over time (not necessarily any supplementary files).
2. The Archivist needs the ETD system to provide improved findability and access to the ETDs, particularly by department or academic subject.
3. The Archivist needs to respond to users who report that they are unable to access content. In this way, she often serves as the "front line" for preservation/access issues.
4. The Archivist wants the ETD system to provide open access (9unless where required to do otherwise) to ETDs for researchers who don’t have access to ProQuest.
