## Characteristics
The System Administrator has responsibility for the technical management of the system.  The System Administrator must ensure that the system is highly available, responsive/performant, and that there are no technical problems that interfere with others performing their roles with respect to the system.  The System Administrator also is responsible for management of accounts on the system (which may be linked to the institutional identity management system) and assigning the appropriate roles and permissions to users.

## Goals
1. The System Administrator needs to be able to monitor space and resource usage in order to proactively allocate more space or other resources to prevent problems.
2. The System Administrator must be able to assign roles/permissions (within the application) to any user in the system.
3. The System Administrator must be able to monitor for problems such as unsuccessful uploads, broken pages, and others.
4. The System Administrator needs to apply software upgrades periodically and ensure that all users can still perform their functions after the upgrade.
