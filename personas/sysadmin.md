## Characteristics
The System Administrator has responsibility for the technical management of the system, including the application and the servers on which it runs.  The System Administrator must ensure that the system is highly available, responsive/performant, and that there are no technical problems that interfere with others performing their roles with respect to the system.  The System Administrator is responsible for backups, restoring from backups, and redeploying the system on new servers as needed.

The System Administrator is also responsible for management of user accounts within the application (which may be linked to the institutional identity management system) and assigning the appropriate roles and permissions to users.

## Goals
1. The System Administrator needs to be able to monitor space and resource usage in order to proactively allocate more space or other resources to prevent problems.
2. The System Administrator must be able to assign roles/permissions within the application to any user.
3. The System Administrator must be able to monitor for, and be proactively notified about, problems such as unsuccessful uploads, broken pages, script or job failures, and others.
4. The System Administrator needs to apply software upgrades periodically and ensure that all users can still perform their functions after the upgrade.
