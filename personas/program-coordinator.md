![headshot](images/program-coordinator-sm.png)

## Characteristics
The Program Coordinator works in the graduate school directly with the graduate students from the time of enrollment through the submission of the student’s thesis or dissertation, and clearance for graduation.  The program coordinator/school administrator plays a key role in ensuring the student meets all the requirements for graduation, including the timely completion of the ETD submission process as part of those graduation requirements.

## Goals
The Program Coordinator wants to be able to:

1. Rretrieve the descriptive metadata and a copy of a student’s thesis or dissertation as a record of a completed partial requirement of graduation.
2. Produce reports specific to his or her program or department’s scholarly output. This data may include a breakdown of what was produced by the school or department during a period of time (total number of ETDs, number broken down by topic, advisor, etc.), and usage analytics, 
be numerical in nature, perhaps in terms of usage or views, etc.
3. Find dissertations/thesis appropriate to highlight on website to advertise type of research being done in department.
4. Answer questions from the public about how to search and retrieve ETDs.
