## Characteristics
The Program Coordinator works in the graduate school directly with the graduate students from the time of enrollment through the submission of the student’s thesis or dissertation, and clearance for graduation.  The program coordinator/school administrator plays a key role in ensuring the student meets all the requirements for graduation, including the timely completion of the ETD submission process as part of those graduation requirements.

be numerical in nature, perhaps in terms of usage or views, etc.
3. Find dissertations/thesis appropriate to highlight on website to advertise type of research being done in department.
4. Be able to answer questions from the public about how to search and retrieve ETDs.
