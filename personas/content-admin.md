# Content Administrator

Placeholder for image

## Characteristics
The Content Administrator is a librarian who has responsibility for ensuring that new ETDs are successfully added to the ETD system, and that the metadata of each ETD is correct and complete.  The Content Administrator is also the adminstrator of GW's ETD content in the other system(s) involved in the ETD workflow, and is one of the most knowledgeable people at the library about ETD metadata.

The Content Administrator is not a software developer, so the Content Administrator has had to turn to software developers when there are problems with the fragile legacy scripts that move ETDs from third-party systems to GW, where these scripts - when they work - create a basic web page for ETDs.

## Goals
TBD
