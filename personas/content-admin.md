# Content Administrator
![headshot](images/content administrator.jpg)


## Characteristics
The Content Administrator is a librarian who has responsibility for ensuring that new ETDs are successfully added to the ETD system, and that the metadata of each ETD is correct and complete.  The Content Administrator also determines when ETDs should be published (made public) in the ETD system.  The Content Administrator is also the adminstrator of GW's ETD content in the other system(s) involved in the ETD workflow, and is knowledgeable about ETD metadata.

The Content Administrator is not a software developer, so the Content Administrator has had to turn to technical system administrators and/or software developers when there are problems with the fragile legacy scripts that move ETDs from third-party systems to GW, where these scripts - when they work - create a basic web page for ETDs.

## Goals
1.  The Content Administrator must be able to edit the metadata of any ETD in the system.
2.  The Content Administrator must be able to add or remove file attachments to any ETD in the system.
3.  The Content Administrator must be able to upload new ETDs to the system.
4.  The Content Administrator must be able to change the visibility of any ETD in the system between public and private (i.e. hidden or not publicly visible)
5.  The Content Administrator must be able to delete ETDs from the system.
6.  The Content Administrator must have visibility into the flow of ETDs from third-party systems to the ETD system, including possible automated upload/ingest.
