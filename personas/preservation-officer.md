![headshot](images/preservationofficer.jpg)

## Characteristics
The Preservation Officer is a librarian who is responsible for working with others across the library to plan for long-term access to digital library content, including ETDs, scholarly works, archived university records, and digital surrogates of collection material. He is responsible for documenting what commitments the library has made to making which digital content accessible long-term, in the form of digital preservation policies.

He is responsible for working with the [Systems Administrator](/personas/sysadmin.md) to estimate the cost of maintaining and providing access this material. He is responsible for communicating these costs to curators, to help them make collection development decisions.

He is responsible for developing the workflows to implement the digital preservation policies, and working with the [Archivist](/personas/archivist.md) and [Systems Administrator](/personas/sysadmin.md) to implement these workflows.


## Goals
1. The Preservation Officer's primary goal is the long-term preservation of the libraries' permanent digital materials, which is defined as the ability to access and use the main body of that content over time. He is concerned with how to make commitments for preservation that the libraries have the resources to meet long-term. 
2. The Preservation Officer needs the system to provide bit-level preservation of all repository material (including ETDs), and the means to recover from bit-level errors.
3. The Preservation Officer is also concerned with preserving access to the primary ETD files, although not as concerned about providing anything beyond bit-level preservation of supplementary files.
4. The Preservation Officer is concerned about being able to monitor system-wide use of resources (storage grown, staff time spent on preservation, reports from users for inability to access content).
5. The Preservation Office is responsible for migrating the ETDs, metadata, and embargo data into a new system in the future, when this system is retired.
